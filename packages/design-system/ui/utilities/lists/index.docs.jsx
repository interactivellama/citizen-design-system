    <p className="site-text-introduction">A list groups related content together.</p>
    <p>This CSS framework is built to create enterprise applications, so lists rarely need their default styling. All lists start by having their defaults reset to <code>margin: 0</code> and <code>padding: 0</code> with no list markers. When using a screen reader, a list is announced along with the number of items it contains.</p>
    <p>When creating a basic page rather than application style, surround the group of headings, paragraphs, and lists with the <CodeClass className="text-longform"/> class to retain their default spacing. </p>
    <p>By default, a list is vertical, but you can change it to horizontal using these utility classes.</p>
