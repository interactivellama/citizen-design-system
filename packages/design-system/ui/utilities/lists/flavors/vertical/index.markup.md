A vertical list stacks like a normal `<ul>`. The `.{{cssPrefix}}has-block-links` added to the `<ul>` sets the links within to `display: block`. They have no underline on hover. The links are typically used for navigation. To indent nested items, add the 
`.{{cssPrefix}}is-nested` class to the `<ul>` nested inside.
