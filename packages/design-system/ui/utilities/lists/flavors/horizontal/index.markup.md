A horizontal list aligns the list items horizontally from left to right.

The horizontal list accepts other helpful utilities that can alter the look of the list items. If you have anchor links in your list items, adding the class `.slds-has-inline-block-links` or `.slds-has-block-links` to the `<ul class=slds-list--horizontal>` will set a display inline-block or block to the anchor links. If you have anchor links within your horizontal list with dividers and want spacing on the links, using `.slds-has-inline-block-links-space` will reset the spacing on the list item and re-apply that padding to the anchor link.
