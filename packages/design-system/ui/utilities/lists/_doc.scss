/**
 * This CSS framework is built to create enterprise applications, so lists rarely need their default styling. All lists start by having their defaults reset to `margin: 0` and `padding: 0` with no list markers. When using a screen reader, a list is announced along with the number of items it contains.
 *
 * When creating a basic page rather than application style, surround the group of headings, paragraphs, and lists with the `.slds-text-longform` class to retain their default spacing.
 *
 * By default, a list is vertical, but you can change it to horizontal using these utility classes.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * In most cases, you should always try to be using ordered/unordered list or
 * description list HTML structure. If for reasons unknown, you cannot use a list,
 * please make sure you add `role="list"` to your top level element and `role="listitem"`
 * to each descendant element under `role="list"`.
 *
 * @summary A list groups related content together.
 *
 * @utility
 * @name lists
 * @selector [class*='slds-list']
 * @support dev-ready
