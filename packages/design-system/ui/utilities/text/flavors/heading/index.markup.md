The large heading helpers create large headings. On smaller form factors, these appear the
same size as medium headings, but bolder. On larger form factors, they are
lighter and bigger.

**These are rarely used in the app**, and are reserved for extremely large
text to showcase data (such as totals or stats).

The medium heading helper is typically the largest heading on a page and usually designates a page title.

Small Headings are used for smaller content areas such as list sections or
card titles.

Label headers are used for small mini headers that don&rsquo;t need to bring
visual attention to themselves. They usually label small content areas like
table columns and list sections.

Label header normal are headers that are not all caps.

Label header bold are headers that are not all caps with bold weight.
