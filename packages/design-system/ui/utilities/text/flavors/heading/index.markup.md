The large heading helpers create large headings. On smaller form factors, these appear the
same size as medium headings, but bolder. On larger form factors, they are
lighter and bigger.

**These are rarely used in the app**, and are reserved for extremely large
text to showcase data (such as totals or stats).

The medium heading helper is typically the largest heading on a page and usually designates a page title.

Small Headings are used for smaller content areas such as list sections or
card titles.
