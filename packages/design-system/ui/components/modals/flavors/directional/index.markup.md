These are modals that require a linearly directional paradigm of navigation
(&ldquo;Next&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo;, etc.) &mdash; the actionable
buttons in the modal footer live on the left and right, rather than all on the
right. These can either be within a large or default modal, depending on the
use case.
