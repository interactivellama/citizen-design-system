The overflow menu for docked composer (`.{{cssPrefix}}docked-composer__overflow`) displays when the number of docked composers exceeds the width of the viewport. The overflow pill displays with a number indicator for all hidden docked composers. A user can invoke a popover with all available docked composers and replace the furthest left docked composer with the one being selected.
