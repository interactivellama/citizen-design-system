<ComponentDocs>
<p className="site-text-introduction">The {globals.displayName} grid, based on Flexbox, provides a flexible, mobile-first, device-agnostic scaffolding system. It includes helper classes that you can use to alter the look and behavior of your grid, such as alignment, order, flow, and padding helpers.</p>
<p>The grid system consists of two building blocks: the grid wrapper (<CodeClass className="grid"/>) and the columns (<CodeClass className="col"/>) that fill up the wrapper.</p>
<h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--label')}>Grid Wrapper</h2>
<p>To use the grid system, add the class <CodeClass className="grid"/> to an element, component, or page layout. Grids can be nested, so you might have to override an inherited property. Some helper classes are available for this situation.</p>
<p>Adding the class <CodeClass className="wrap"/> causes the flow of your <CodeClass className="col"/> elements to wrap when they exceed 100% of their parentâ€™s width. You can use <CodeClass className="nowrap"/> to revert this behavior and allow your element to stretch and not wrap.</p>
<p>To stack your columns vertically instead of the default row behavior, use <CodeClass className="grid--vertical"/>.</p>
<p>If you want your application to take 100% of the width and height of the viewport and nest other grids within, use the top-level app helper class <CodeClass className="grid--frame"/>.</p>


<h2 className={pf('site-text-heading--label')}>Grid Columns</h2>
<p>By default, the grid columns use an equal amount of space in the parent container. This automatic sizing allows you to achieve most desired outcomes. However, you can add manual sizing classes to the columns if you need specific column widths.</p>
<p>Columns have no gutters. They are simply equal divisions of their parent. If you want gutters, remove the class <CodeClass className="col"/> with the helper class <CodeClass className="col--padded"/>, which adds a 0.75rem (12px) gutter to the left and right side of your column.</p>
<p>Using the manual sizing class helpers, you can specify a column span across the following grids &ndash;2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12. The grid supports up to 12 columns.</p>
<p>See <Link to="/components/utilities/sizing/">sizing utilities</Link> for more information and examples.</p>
