If a comment thread exceeds 3 replies, those comments should be hidden on page load and replaced with a call to action that explains the amount of comments that are hidden. If the user interacts with the overflow button, the button should be removed and replaced with the hidden comment `<li>`.

If the overflow state is active, it is best practice to show the latest comment and the comment publisher.
