To initialize the comment, apply the `.{{cssPrefix}}comment` class to a containing `<div>`. A comment that is associated to a user, should be wrapped within a `.{{cssPrefix}}media` object. This layout helper will properly align the avatar and body of the comment.

For available classes and options, see the <a href="#overview">comment overview legend</a> below.
