The tooltip should be positioned with JavaScript.

You can include inline help tooltips for form elements and any focusable items, such as anchor links, buttons, etc. If your tooltips are available on hover, also make sure that theyâ€™re available on keyboard focus. To allow screen readers to access the tooltip, the HTML form field element must  have an `aria-describedby` attribute that points to the tooltip `ID` of the tooltip.
