A multi-select picklist is a list of actionable items that is invoked by selection of a particular item(s). The multi-select picklist can have more than one selected option. When more than one option has been selected, the `.{{cssPrefix}}picklist__label` test should update with the total number of selected items, such as "3 options selected". When the picklist loses focus but has items selected, a `.{{cssPrefix}}pill__container--bare` should be display below the `.{{cssPrefix}}picklist__label` with the selected items in pills, allowing a user to easily remove selected items.
