Add this `.{{cssPrefix}}x-small-button--stacked` class to `.{{cssPrefix}}button` for buttons that need vertical spacing. If you want to have a parent class that spaces all the buttons inside of it, use `.{{cssPrefix}}x-small-buttons--stacked` on the parent. If you want to change which breakpoint this behavior happens in, switch `x-small` for `small`, `medium`, or `large`. You can also add `max` before the sizing to switch it to go up to the size instead of at least that size (such as `.{{cssPrefix}}max-small-button--stacked`).
