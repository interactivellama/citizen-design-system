A hint button is grayed out until its parent is hovered over. Then the hover and focus states are just like a regular icon button.

The parent element must have the class `.{{cssPrefix}}hint-parent`, and the icon inside the button has the class `.{{cssPrefix}}button__icon--hint`.

Use the small button with the down icon in rows and action menus. Add the class `.{{cssPrefix}}button--icon-border-small` on the button. Use `.{{cssPrefix}}button__icon--small` for the inside icon.
