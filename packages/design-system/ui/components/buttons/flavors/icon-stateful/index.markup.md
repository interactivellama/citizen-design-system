Stateful icons can be toggled on and off and retain their state. Like stateful buttons, the initial state is `.{{cssPrefix}}not-selected`, and JavaScript is used to toggle it to `.{{cssPrefix}}is-selected` when activated.

<h4 class="site-text-heading--label">Accessibility</h4>

For accessibility, use a span to describe what the button does. Use .`.{{cssPrefix}}assistive-text` to visually hide it.
