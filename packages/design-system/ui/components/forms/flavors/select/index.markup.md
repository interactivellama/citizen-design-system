The HTML `<select>` element presents a menu of options. The options within the menu are represented by `<option>` elements that you can group with `<optgroup>` elements. You can pre-select options for the user.

For a multiple options selections, adding the attribute `multiple` to the `<select>` will enable this functionality. Note, if you need multiple option selections, you will need to remove the `<div class="slds-select_container">` from the DOM, otherwise you'll get display issues.

If you need more advanced styling, consider using a [Picklist](/components/menus#picklist).
