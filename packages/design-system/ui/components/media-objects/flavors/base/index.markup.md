This is the base version of the media object. The container for this object can be any HTML element. It should have the class `.{{cssPrefix}}media` placed on the container. Inside are the two required elements. The figure (image, icon, etc) should be placed inside an element with the `.{{cssPrefix}}media__figure` class. The information associated with it should be placed in an element with the `.{{cssPrefix}}media__body` class.

By default, the text starts at the top of the figure. Use the centered variant to center the text and figure.
