Use the double media object to place a figure on both the right and left of the text.

As in the base media object, place both the `.{{cssPrefix}}media__figure` elements before the `.{{cssPrefix}}media__body`. The figure that displays on the right also receives the `.{{cssPrefix}}media__figure--reverse` class.
