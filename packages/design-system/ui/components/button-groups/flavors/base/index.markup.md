When the icon button is disabled, it disappears. When the disabled attribute is placed on the icon button, the `.{{cssPrefix}}button--last` class must be appended to the final button in the group. If the last button is wrapped in another element, place the `.{{cssPrefix}}button--last` class on the wrapping element instead.

For the inverse version of the button group, use the `.{{cssPrefix}}button--inverse` class.

Note: The inverse group is seen on the edit dashboard. The disabled attribute might not be applicable in this situation.
