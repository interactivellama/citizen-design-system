A figure component is a self-contained unit of content, such as an image with an optional caption. The figure component should NOT be used with icons or logos. A figure can optionally be cropped to a specific ratio such as 16x9, 4x3 and 1x1 with the use of `.slds-image__crop` and passing in a ratio class such as `.slds-image__crop--16-by-9`.
