- Removed first and last cell padding from Data Tables to allow nesting. New
  class `.slds-table--cell-buffer` can be added to the table or `.slds-cell-buffer--left` and `.slds-cell-buffer--right` for individual cell application.
- Field level help icon moved to the right of the input label

**DEPRECATED**

The following features are being marked as deprecated in this release and will be removed in three releases:

**REMOVED**

The following features are being removed in this release:

- Removed `slds-input--small`, since it’s the same as the new default input size
- Removed the `$static-icon-path` configuration variable, since it wasn’t used anywhere in the codebase
