      The {g.displayName} is ready to use in your Lightning apps and
      components. It is now automatically included for Lightning Components
      running in the Lightning Experience and Salesforce S1 mobile application. It is no longer necessary to add a static resource for
      Lightning Components running within these environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/lightning_out.htm">Lightning Out</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/components_visualforce.htm?search_text=lc4vf">LC4VC</a>, and <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/apps_intro.htm">Lightning Application</a> automatically get the Lightning Design System
      stylesheets and design tokens if they extend <code>force:slds</code>.
      This is the easiest way to stay up-to-date and consistent with SLDS
      enhancements.</p>

    <p>To extend <code>force:slds</code>, your application should look like this:</p>
    <div className={pf('site-code--content scrollable--x')}>
      <CodeBlock language="html">{`
      <aura:application extends="force:slds">
      <!-- customize your application here -->
      </aura:application>
      `}</CodeBlock>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you still need to use a static resource with the scoped files that were previously included in the download, we have <a href="https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer">provided a tool for you to create your custom-scoped CSS</a>. You will need to scope to your own unique scoping class name instead of <code>.slds</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have prepared
      a <a href={lightningTutorialUrl}>self-guided workshop</a> to guide you
      through installation, usage, and examples. It includes details on how to
      use the Design System SVG spritemap icons in Lightning components.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note the following when using the Lightning Design System with
      Lightning components:
    </p>

    <ul className={pf('list--dotted')}>
      <li>
        When using the component sample code from the Trailhead module, be
        sure to replace all static resource paths with the Lightning resource
        URL syntax, as summarized in
        the <a href="/faq#how-do-i-link-to-lightning-static-resources-like-stylesheets-and-icons">FAQ</a> (You should no longer need to link to the CSS portion of your static resource)
      </li>

      <li>
        For details on how to use the Design System SVG spritemap icons in
        Lightning components, please review
        the <a href={lightningTutorialUrl}>tutorial</a> which covers this in
        detail. Also note that when using SVG spritemap image icons with MSIE
        you will need to use a small script
        called <a href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody">svg4everybody</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        For details on how to use Design Tokens, read our documentation
        on <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/tokens_intro.htm">Styling with Design Tokens</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        You can also find a range of open-sourced sample components in
        the <a href="https://github.com/ForceDotComLabs/sldsx">ForceDotComLabs/sldsx</a> project
        on GitHub.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Finally, weâ€™d love to hear your feedback. Share your thoughts about any
      aspect of this
      tutorial or the {g.displayName} in general via
      our <a href="https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
