      The {g.displayName} is ready to use in your Lightning apps and components.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have prepared a <a href={lightningTutorialUrl}>self-guided workshop</a> to guide you through installation, usage, and examples. It also includes details on how to use the Design System SVG spritemap icons in Lightning components.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also find a range of open-sourced sample components in the <a href="https://github.com/ForceDotComLabs/sldsx">ForceDotComLabs/sldsx</a> project on github.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, please note the following when using the Lightning Design System with Lightning components:
    </p>
    <ul className={pf('list--dotted')}>
      <li>When using the component sample code from this site, be sure to replace all static resource paths with the Lightning resource URL syntax, as summarized in the <a href="/faq#how-do-i-link-to-lightning-static-resources-like-stylesheets-and-icons">FAQ</a></li>
      <li>
        For details on how to use the Design System SVG spritemap icons in Lightning components, please review the <a href={lightningTutorialUrl}>tutorial</a> which covers this in detail.  Also note that when using SVG spritemap image icons with MSIE you will need to use a small script called <a href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody">svg4everybody</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Finally, weâ€™d love to hear your feedback. Share your thoughts about any aspect of this
      tutorial or the {g.displayName} in general via our <a href="https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system/issues">GitHub issues</a>.
